# titanic-nlp-ai
 Titanic survival prediction using NLP and ML with Gradio UI

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on a textual description. It uses a Random Forest classifier and a Gradio web interface for interaction.

## Features

-   Trains a Random Forest model on the Titanic dataset.
-   Uses a scikit-learn pipeline for preprocessing (imputation, scaling, one-hot encoding).
-   Extracts features (Age, Sex, Pclass, Fare, Embarked, SibSp, Parch) from user-provided text using SpaCy for NLP.
-   Provides a Gradio web interface for easy prediction.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    # git clone <your-repo-url>
    # cd titanic-nlp-ai
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Download SpaCy NLP model:**
    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Train the model (if `titanic_rf_pipeline.pkl` is not already present or needs retraining):**
    Navigate to the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    python model_training.py
    ```
    This will download the Titanic dataset, train the model, and save `titanic_rf_pipeline.pkl`.

2.  **Launch the Gradio Web Application:**
    Ensure `titanic_rf_pipeline.pkl` is in the same directory. Then run:
    ```bash
    python titanic_nlp_gradio_app.py
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:7860` (Gradio will print the URL). Open this URL in your web browser.

## How to Use

Once the Gradio app is running:
1.  Enter a textual description of a Titanic passenger in the input box.
    *   Example: "A 30 year old male, 1st class, embarked at Southampton, paid 50 dollars."
2.  The application will display the predicted survival status, the probability of survival, and the features it extracted from your text.

## Notes

-   The feature extraction from text is rule-based and may not be perfect for all phrasings.
-   The model's performance is based on the classic Titanic dataset and the features used.
